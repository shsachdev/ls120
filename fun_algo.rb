def anagram(word, words)
end



#Â words = []

# word = str


# Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list.

# input = str, arr; output = arr

# Algorithm

# 1. Iterate through each element in words and see if it is anagram with word.
  # to check if anagram, we can define a method is_anagram?

# is_anagram? (implementation)
  # iterate through each char of both strings (using each_char)
  # create a hash of the form: char => count (for each string)
  # compare hashes; if they are equal, then the words are anagrams of each other, and is_anagram? returns true.  
# 2. if it is, add it to an array.
# 3. return this array (empty or not)
