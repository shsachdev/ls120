# Example

ada = Person.new('Ada')
ada.location = GeoLocation.new(53.477, -2.236)

grace = Person.new('Grace')
grace.location = GeoLocation.new(-33.89, 151.277)

ada.teleport_to(-33.89, 151.277)

puts ada.location                   # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts grace.location                 # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts ada.location == grace.location # expected: true
                                    # actual: false

# On line 39 of our original code, we invoke the == method to compare the equality
# of two locations. Since our GeoLocation class does not implement ==, Ruby invokes
# the method from the BasicObject class. BasicObject#==, however, returns true
# only if the two objects being compared are the same object, or in other words, if they
# have the same object id.

# In order to compare the equality of instances of our custom class based on the value of their attributes,
# we need to define a == method in our custom class, which overrides BasicObject#==. GeoLocation#== does
# exactly that: it compares two locations based on their latitude and longitude values.
