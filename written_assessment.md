Today I start prepping for the LS 120 Written Assessment.

Some specifics to keep in mind (and to study for):

- Classes and Objects
- Setter and Getters
- Instance Methods vs Class Methods
- Referencing and setting instance variables vs. using getters and setters
- Class inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Modules
- Method lookup path
- Self
  - Calling methods with self
  - More about self
- Reading OO Code
- Fake operators and equality
- Truthiness
- Working with collaborator objects
