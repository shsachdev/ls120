# We refer to the initialize method as a constructor, becaause it gets triggered whenever we create a new object.

# Modules are used only for namespacing and grouping common methods together.
# Namespacing means organizing similar classes under a module.

# Private methods are not accessible outside of the class definition at all, and are only
# accessible from inside the class when called without self.
